Digital Signal Processing

This project is in honor of Dr. Ndung'u - the university lecturer who taught us Digital signal processing.
Unfortunately, the doc passed on abruptly and will not see this - but we'll do it either way.

So just in case you read the code and you start tearing for whatever reason, just remember this code was written in mourning and intellectual giant.
